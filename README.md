# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.
The objective is to analyze the dataset, identify patterns and trends, and present actionable insights through **SQL analysis, Python-based EDA, and an interactive Power BI dashboard**, supported by a written report and presentation.

---

## Dataset

* Source: *Public / Internal / Simulated dataset*
* Format: CSV / Excel
* Size: *X rows, Y columns*
* Description:
  The dataset contains structured records related to business/operational metrics such as dates, categories, numerical measures, and identifiers used for analysis and reporting.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
* **Databases & SQL:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Reporting:** MS Word / PDF
* **Presentation:** Gamma (AI-powered PPT creation)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas.
* Loaded cleaned data into relational databases (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed data distribution, trends, and outliers.
* Performed univariate and multivariate analysis.
* Generated summary statistics and visual insights.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values and duplicates.
* Standardized column names and data types.
* Removed invalid or inconsistent records to ensure data quality.

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Wrote optimized SQL queries using:

  * `JOINs`
  * `GROUP BY`
  * `CASE` statements
  * Subqueries and aggregations
* Answered key business questions using structured queries.

### 5. Dashboard Development

* Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** featuring:

  * KPI cards
  * Trend analysis
  * Filters and slicers
  * Category-wise and time-based insights

### 6. Reporting & Presentation

* Created a structured analytical report explaining findings.
* Designed a concise presentation using **Gamma**, focusing on insights, visuals, and recommendations.

## Dashboard

**Key Highlights:**

* High-level KPIs for quick decision-making
* Trend analysis over time
* Drill-down views for detailed insights
* User-friendly filters for dynamic exploration

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
* Highlighted performance drivers and areas of improvement.
* Delivered insights in a format suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
